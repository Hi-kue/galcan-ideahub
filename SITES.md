# Interesting Sites I have Found (ISIF)

## Introduction

This markdown file is a curation of interesting sites I have found over the years on the internet as I develop myself as a software engineer. Some sites are for learning, some are for resources, some are related to nothing in particular. The reason why I intend to put these here is to have a list or central repository of sites and ideas that I can refer from time to time without losing any crucial information if (and thats a BIG if) I happen to lose the data stored in my local machine.

The way it goes is that I will find a site, bookmark for a duration and send it over here coupled with a brief description of what the site is all about. 

> [!WARNING]
> This document is constantly changing, chances are there might be a site that is not available anymore or that I don't find interesting, so It will most likely be removed in the future. However, you can always look through the git history to find the site that was previously removed as that's usually the best case to find the site. Also, I will try to keep the list updated as much as possible but bear patience with me as I am very good at procrastinating.
