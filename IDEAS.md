## Idea Name `ID000001`

**TLDR'd** for Startup Companies - Platform to "TLDR" startup companies, rather than reading through long articles, to get a quick overview of the company.

### Description

I was in a meeting where we were ordered to look at 7 companies in under 2 minutes and think about what they do as a company, who their market is and what their product is. *2 minutes?* thats unreasonable as it takes time to read through even their landing page before figuring out what they do.

Given this, there should be a platform, or some software out there that can "TLDR" a company for you. This would be a great tool for invenstors, people looking to get information about a company quickly, or even for people who are just curious about what a company does.

> **NOTE:** The name is temporary, and obviously not the best name for any company but suggestions are more than welcome.

### Features

> **NOTE:** Features are not limited, and are still being thought of at the moment.

### Market Metrics
