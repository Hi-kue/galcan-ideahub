# Introduction

Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bilal, a software engineer who loves to build things. I dedicate this repository to my personal ideas and thoughts on various topics that I find interest me. I intend to use this repository as a way to keep track of my ideas for potential SaaS, BaaS, or other products that could be possibly made in the future to help solve other peoples problems. 

Some of the ideas may be half-baked, but thats just the nature of ideas, they are meant to be iterated upon and improved. With that being said, to infinity and beyond ðŸš€!

## How Is It Organized?

Each idea will have a structure, and will be organized in such a fashion that is relatively easy to understand, and follow. The structure will look like the following:

```markdown
## Idea Name [Code Name / Reference]
### Description
### Features
### Market Metrics
```

For code name / reference, it will either be a short name or something that I can use to reference the Idea in the future using "find" or "grep" commands.

Most of the ideas will be written in markdown, but some maybe written in other formats such as `.txt`, asciidoc or `.mdx` files, depending on the complexity of the idea.
